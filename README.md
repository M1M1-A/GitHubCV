## Amina Begum

As a professional with over ten years experience in Finance, I'm now on an exciting career shift into Software Development. Over the past year, I've honed my coding skills through independent learning and I've recently completed an intensive Software Development Bootcamp. Coding has sparked a passion in me and has reignited my enthusiasm for learning and continuous improvement. I practice consistently, coding regularly with others and on solo projects that align with my passions for music, design, and technology. My blend of cross-industry experience, alongside my programming skills, equip me with a unique and versatile set of skills with which to transition into Tech.

## Skills 

**Technical skills and continuous learning:**

I began coding using HTML, CSS and Javascript to learn the fundamentals. Later I joined Makers Academy where I built software from backend to frontend, while following Test Driven Development throughout. Analysing customer journeys and behaviours has been integral to my previous roles. I used this insight to write effective test scenarios, covering a range of user interactions. Using Cypress and Jest, I maintained thorough test coverage to provide confidence in the robustness of the app. When faced with bugs, I employed effective debugging skills, using all of my resources to resolve issues. This involved using Chrome dev tools, test error messages, console logs, and reading documentation and to get closer to and eliminate the error. 

Since completing Makers, I’ve continued to refine my skills through group and solo projects, attending workshops, and staying abreast of new technologies through independent learning. Deciding to return to full time studying after almost a decade, and recently completing an intensive bootcamp, is a testament to my commitment to learning and adapting. My past roles in Finance demanded staying up-to-date with ever-evolving Regulatory guidance and complex Bank processes. As a result, I’m accustomed to quickly acquiring knowledge and practically applying it to achieve results.

**Communication (Written and Verbal):**

I’ve gained a lot of experience interacting with a range of stakeholders which has developed me into a confident communicator. While mentoring as a Quality Assurer (QA), I provided tailored feedback to mentees, supporting their progress and learning. At the Financial Conduct Authority, I engaged in challenging conversations with senior leaders in Banks, ensuring their compliance with regulatory standards. At Tandem Bank, I authored procedure documents for Quality Assurance, in preparation for the bank's scale-up. Additionally, I delivered presentations and training where I communicated complex technical information to a variety of audiences. In a previous role as an Adjudicator at the Financial Ombudsman Service, I investigated disputes and used logic and reasoning to reach outcomes and communicate these to customers.

**Collaboration and Stakeholder Management:**

My experience at Tandem Bank involved close collaboration in cross-functional teams across Operations, where I successfully gained buy-in for new procedures and embedded Quality Assurance processes. At Momenta, I was part of a specialised team responsible for resolving high-risk cases. Working closely with my colleagues, we met weekly team targets, each of us handling different aspects of the case work process, necessitating regular updates and communication to deliver results promptly. Together, we successfully resolved all cases within the established deadlines. Additionally, I really enjoy collaborative coding, and recognise that a well-coordinated team can significantly impact the outcome and quality of the end product in software development.

**Adaptability and Proactiveness:**

My adaptability is demonstrated by my experience in transitioning between product areas as a QA, where I had to swiftly comprehend new processes and guidance to resolve cases and deliver outcomes to customers efficiently. At Tandem Bank, I had sole responsibility for redesigning the Quality Assurance process. I’m naturally curious about better ways to do things, and at Tandem I used that curiosity to be proactive about improving processes. I liaised with people across the business, conducted deep dives into systems and practices, and analysed data to identify gaps and improve Operations. 

I’m adept at adapting to changing priorities and do so through great organisation skills. As a QA I managed multiple cases simultaneously, meticulously organising my workflow to ensure each case received proper attention. Despite the varied stages and complexities, I consistently met deadlines and maintained high quality standards in my work. Alongside this, I managed ad-hoc training while also being a technical point of reference for other QA’s. This required effective re-prioritise to deliver in all areas.
