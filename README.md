## Amina Begum

As a professional with over ten years experience in Finance, I'm now on an exciting career shift into Software Development. Over the past year, I've honed my coding skills through independent learning and I've recently completed an intensive Software Development Bootcamp. Coding has sparked a passion in me and has reignited my enthusiasm for learning and continuous improvement. I practice consistently, coding regularly with others and on solo projects that align with my passions for music, design, and technology. My blend of cross-industry experience, alongside my programming skills, equip me with a unique and versatile set of skills with which to transition into Tech.

## Skills 

**Continuous Improvement and Appetite for Learning:**

During my time at Makers Academy, I programmed across two languages, and found myself eager to learn other languages in my spare time. I feel comfortable transitioning between programming languages and maintain a constant curiosity to learn new ones. Deciding to return to full time studying after almost a decade, and recently completing an intensive bootcamp, is a testament to my commitment to learning and adapting. My past roles in Finance demanded staying up-to-date with ever-evolving Regulatory guidance and complex Bank processes. As a result, I’m accustomed to quickly acquiring knowledge and practically applying it to achieve tangible results.

**Communication (Written and Verbal):**

I’ve gained a lot of experience interacting with a range of stakeholders which has developed me into a confident communicator. While mentoring as a Quality Assurer, I provided tailored feedback to mentees, supporting their progress and learning. At the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), I engaged in challenging conversations with senior leaders in Banks, ensuring their compliance with regulatory standards. At Tandem Bank, I authored procedure documents for Quality Assurance, in preparation for the bank's scale-up. Additionally, I confidently delivered presentations to senior teams, communicating data and findings and pitching proposals for improvement. In a previous role as an Adjudicator at the Financial Ombudsman Service, I investigated disputes and used logic and reasoning to reach outcomes and communicate these to customers.

**Collaboration and Stakeholder Management:**

My experience at Tandem Bank involved close collaboration with teams across Operations, where I successfully gained buy-in for new procedures and embedded the Quality Assurance processes. At Momenta, I was part of a specialised team responsible for resolving high-risk cases. Working closely with my colleagues, we met weekly team targets, each of us handling different aspects of the case work process, necessitating regular updates and communication to deliver results promptly. Together, we successfully resolved all cases within the established deadlines. Additionally, I really enjoy collaborative coding, and recognise that a well-coordinated team can significantly impact the outcome and quality of the end product in software development.

**Adaptability, Accountability, and Proactiveness:**

My adaptability is demonstrated by my experience in transitioning between product areas as a Quality Assurer, where I had to swiftly acquire new processes and guidance to resolve cases and deliver outcomes to customers efficiently. My career change from Finance to Tech reflects my proactive approach to learning, as I began my Tech journey independently, employing various research methods and tools to fuel my learning. At Tandem Bank, I had sole responsibility for redesigning the Quality Assurance process. Despite my initial lack of knowledge about the business and the processes of each department, I formulated a comprehensive plan, shadowed experts, gathered and analysed data, and conducted productive meetings with department heads. With this approach, I successfully redesigned, introduced, and embedded the new Quality process within just six months.
